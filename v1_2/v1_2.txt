Net Message
Version 1.2.0
Information
06/04/01

- add a status bar to display connection status (Netscape like) - added 06/29/02
- written in C using Win32 API directly
- allows to establish a Net Message
  message network:

	1. every instance runs three threads
		- main thread (window procs etc)
		- listen thread (listen for new connections)
		- receive thread (receive data)
	2. every instance has a routing table that simply
           stores what hop is to receive a message when
           addressing a certain host
	3. the main window features a list view that displays
           all users available

- alternative way for a network (05/03/05):

	all participating clients simply store a hash-table
	containing all users and their IP-addresses thus
	being able to connect all partners directly.
	on connecting a new client simply requests the
	hash-table from the partner initially connecting to;
	but on disconnecting it will have to broadcast
	to all users to request removal out of the tables
	

source files:

threads.c	- the two sub-threads

routing.c	- code to manage and query the routing table

netmsg.c	- main program code

winsock.c	- functions for winsock access

wndproc.c	- the window procedures

- normal program run:

	- server listens for new connections when
          new user wants to connect to network
        - new user sends broadcast message to all users
        - every user updates his routing table with this
          information:

		struct NMUSER {

			unsigned int address;
			unsigned int interface;
		}

		address and interface can be the same
		when the user is directly connected with
		the host
