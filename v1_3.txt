Net Message
Version 1.3.0
Information
02/28/02


#include "v1_2.txt" (all features of version 1.2) :)

1.3 will feature addtionally the capability to search other
NetMessage users being online in certain subnets that have
been stored addtionally to the NMUSER-struct. Then we need
to have an unique ID for any user so that only users online
will be added to the list who are really the searchers pal.

The search will be performed on logging on and on clicking a
button like "Update User List".

The search goes as follows:

	- go online
	- LOOP:
		- go through the NMUSER-list
		- search a specified subnet for running NetMessage 1.3 or higher
		- check the UID of a user found
		- add to list if UID corresponds with UID in current NMUSER-struct
	- DONE
