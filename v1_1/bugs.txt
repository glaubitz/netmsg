------------------

BUG01:

When receiving a text larger than 128 characters,
the host will crash when disconnecting.
->fixed (06/04/01)

BUG02:

When typing a message and receiving a message before
"send" was clicked, the message typed in will be lost.
This is caused when the variables will be updated
with UpdateData (), we need to call UpdateData ()
first to save the unsent message into its variable.
->fixed (06/06/01)

BUG03:

The "Receiving" window does not scroll automatically.
->fixed (06/07/01)

BUG04:

When trying to dispatch a message with <Return> the
main window will be closed.->fixed (06/07/01)

BUG05:

When starting an instance, clicking "Start Server",
clicking "Cancel" in the SvrWaitDlg, then entering
Host-IP: "127.0.0.1" and then connecting, the instance
will establish a connection with itself.->fixed (06/07/01)

BUG06:

Does not check specified port for validity.

BUG07:

NetMessage does not complain when no port has been specified.
Instead only the MFC internal value checker complains
(in the OS installed native language :( ). After closing
the MFC requester, NetMessage will still try to connect
and of course fail.
